1. **Data Collection:**
   - Imports necessary libraries such as openpyxl, pandas, praw (Python Reddit API Wrapper), and scikit-learn.
   - Downloads NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) resources required for text preprocessing.
   - Loads an Excel workbook from a specified path.
   - Initializes the Reddit API with user-specific credentials (client ID, client secret, and user agent).
   - Retrieves existing data (titles) from the Excel file.

2. **Data Retrieval from Reddit:**
   - Retrieves new posts from the "randomscreenshot" subreddit on Reddit.
   - Checks if the post title already exists in the Excel file to avoid duplicates.
   - Appends new post data (title, score, comments, awards, URL, and link flair) to the Excel file.

3. **User Input and Prediction:**
   - Takes user input for a title to be predicted.
   - Utilizes machine learning techniques (Multinomial Naive Bayes) to predict scores, comments, and awards based on the input title.
   - Presents the predicted title data (score, comments, awards) to the user.

4. **Title Suggestion:**
   - Preprocesses both the Reddit post titles and the user's input title by tokenizing, lowering case, and removing stopwords.
   - Computes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors for titles.
   - Calculates cosine similarities between the input title and all titles in the dataset.
   - Combines the cosine similarity scores with the existing scores to find the best title suggestion.
   - Presents the input title, the best title suggestion, and the maximum combined score to the user.

This script demonstrates a practical application of data collection, text analysis, and machine learning for predicting and suggesting titles based on Reddit data and user input.
